# Implementing a rule based machine learning algorithm
-This repo is created as part of AMMI Bootcamp 2021
-using some [train](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/train_data.txt) and [test](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/test_data.txt) data we implement a prediction algorithms based on simple rules deduced from exploring the data and the correlation between features and we got good accuracy of 89%
this repo contains:
- first convert text data to data frames [utils](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/utils.py)
- visualize the data to observe relationships between features [visualization](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/visualization.py)
- implementing the model [model](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/model.py)
- main fucntion that run the model and checks its accuracy (main)[https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/main.py]

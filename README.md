# Implementing a rule based machine learning algorithm
This repo is created as part of AMMI Bootcamp 2021
using some [train](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/train_data.txt) and [test](https://github.com/AMNAALMGLY/AMMI2021_Bootcamp_project/blob/master/test_data.txt) data we implement a prediction algorithms based on simple rules deduced from exploring the data and the correlation between features
